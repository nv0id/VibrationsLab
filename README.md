# Vibrations Lab for Year 2 MEng degree

## Abstract

> The important role that spring-damper systems play in the modern world cannot be understated. In this lab, a real bike shock absorber was tested experimentally using a dynamometer, and its characteristics measured. It was found that the calibration coefficient was 0.0606 m/sV and the spring constant 69.880 kNm−1. The damper was found to exhibit quasi-ideal behavior when tested with differences being found at the extremities of motion. The experiment’s objective to fully investigate the characteristics of a real-world spring-damper system were deemed to be met.
